       "'every now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio , with every indication that it will be a stinker , and to everybody\\'s surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling . \\nmtv films\\' _election , a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon , is a current example . \\ndid anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ? \\nthe plot is deceptively simple . \\ngeorge washington carver high school is having student elections . \\ntracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question , way , way , high . \\nmr . \" m \" ( matthew broderick ) , sick of the megalomaniac student , encourages paul , a popular-but-slow jock to run . \\nand paul\\'s nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well , for personal reasons . \\nthe dark side of such sleeper success is that , because expectations were so low going in , the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be . \\nyou can\\'t help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews , which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have . \\n_election , a good film , does not live up to its hype . \\nwhat makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_ , released a few months earlier . \\nthe similarities are staggering : \\ntracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \\nmax fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs , and is involved with the school play . \\nthe most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \\nthe most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student . \\ntracy flick is from a single parent home , which has contributed to her drive . \\nmax fischer is from a single parent home , which has contributed to his drive . \\nthe male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \\nhe even gets a bee sting . \\nthe male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair , gets caught , and his whole life is ruined . \\nhe gets several bee stings . \\nand so on . \\nwhat happened ? \\nhow is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points , and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other , made from two different studios , from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadn\\'t been fully formed yet ? \\neven so , the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick , witherspoon , and newcomer jessica campbell , as paul\\'s anti-social sister , tammy . \\nbroderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_ , and he seems to be having the most fun he\\'s had since then . \\nwitherspoon is a revelation . \\nit\\'s early in the year , it\\'s a comedy , and teenagers have little clout , but for my money , witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination . \\nand once campbell\\'s character gets going , like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium , then you\\'re won over . \\none thing that\\'s been bothering me since i\\'ve seen it . \\nthere is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film . \\ni suppose that , coming from mtv films , i should expect no less . . . \\nbut the film starts off light and airy , like a sitcom . \\nas the screws tighten , and the tensions mount , alexander payne decides to add elements that , frankly , distract from the story . \\nit is bad enough that mr . m doesn\\'t like tracy\\'s determination to win at all costs , but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ? \\neven so , there\\'s no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does . \\nthere\\'s a lot to like in _election_ , but the plot similarities to _rushmore_ , and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven , mark this as a disappointment . \\n'"
