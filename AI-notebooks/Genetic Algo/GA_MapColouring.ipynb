Genetic Algorithms\n","# Task 3.3 The Map Colouring Problem\n","## Problem Descriptions\n","\n","Implement a GA such that with use of 4 colour, we colour all the map areas with no adjacent area with same colour.\n"," We have 11 names in the map and we are given 4 colours.\n","To represent the neighbourhood information into in the map we introduce an upper\n","triangular matrix where 1 for neighbours and 0 for not.\n","we have 4 colours to colour the map areas. \n","\n","-------\n","##-\n","\n","## Implementation and Results\n","  * Encoding scheme\n","\n","Data structure used in this problem is array of numbers. Each array contains element equal to number of areas in the map. Value at the index position repersents the colour . Colour array contains the 4 colours encoded with integer values. \n","\n","    [0,1,2,3] ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'gray')\n","    sample individual = [1, 3, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2, 3, 3, 2]\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"," * initial population\n","\n","initial population is genrated with random numbers ranging from 0-4 , to an array length of 11.\n","\n","\n","* fitness function\n","\n"," The fitness function is to evaluate the number of neighbouring regions that have a\n","same colour. so, by design it is a minimisation problem. If individuals will have less number of neighbours with same adjacent colours, better it is suited for next generation.\n","\n","* Mutation\n","\n","for mutation we are using here \"mutUniformInt\" . Mutate an individual by replacing attributes, with probability indpb, by a integer uniformly drawn between low and up inclusively\n","\n","* crossover\n","\n","for crossover we have used \"cxTwoPoint\" , it is two point crossover. The two individuals are modified in place and both keep in their original length and returned.\n","\n","* selection\n","\n","for selection we are using tournament selection, which will ensure the best individual in the population. Here, selection will be based on the fitness score from the fitness function."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"BprDObXyHJBV","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1677604298472,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":6167,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kumar","userId":"17706325443169451019"}},"outputId":"f4f9efd0-53f8-4d2b-c7d9-9b82404aabff"},"source":["!pip install deap\n","import array\n","import random\n","import numpy as np\n","from deap import creator, base, tools, algorithms"],"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting deap\n","  Downloading deap-1.3.3-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_5_x86_64.manylinux1_x86_64.manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl (139 kB)\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m139.9/139.9 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25hRequirement already satisfied: numpy in /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages (from deap) (1.22.4)\n","Installing collected packages: deap\n","Successfully installed deap-1.3.3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import time"],"metadata":{"id":"PnyQJDeU32Du"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"smxceTnEymf7"},"source":["# Specify the variables\n","numColour = 4\n","numNames = 11\n","colours = ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'gray')\n","names = ('Mark', 'Julia', 'Steve', 'Amanda', 'Brian', \n","         'Joanne', 'Derek', 'Allan', 'Michelle', 'Kelly', 'Chris')\n","\n","# Define the neighbours\n","neighbours =  [ [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],\n","                [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FGcjQHrUHWyu"},"source":["def evalMapColouring(ind):\n","    val = 0\n","    for i in range(0, numNames):\n","      for j in range(0, numNames):\n","        if (neighbours[i][j] == 1) and (ind[i] == ind[j]):\n","            val += 1\n","    return val,\n","    \n","creator.create(\"FitnessMin\", base.Fitness, weights=(-1.0,))\n","creator.create(\"Individual\", array.array, typecode='i', fitness=creator.FitnessMin)\n","\n","toolbox = base.Toolbox()\n","toolbox.register(\"attr_colour\", random.randint, 0, numColour-1)\n","toolbox.register(\"individual\", tools.initRepeat, creator.Individual, toolbox.attr_colour, numNames)\n","toolbox.register(\"population\", tools.initRepeat, list, toolbox.individual)\n","\n","toolbox.register(\"evaluate\", evalMapColouring)\n","toolbox.register(\"mate\", tools.cxTwoPoint)\n","toolbox.register(\"mutate\", tools.mutUniformInt, low=0, up=numColour-1, indpb=0.05)\n","toolbox.register(\"select\", tools.selTournament, tournsize=10)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"fDdDaVawHrC4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1668458787910,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":224,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kumar","userId":"17706325443169451019"}},"outputId":"688ad559-0eed-446a-b022-6996245c2646"},"source":["pop = toolbox.population(n=10)\n","stats = tools.Statistics(lambda ind: ind.fitness.values)\n","stats.register(\"min\", np.min)\n","st = time.time()\n","pop, log = algorithms.eaSimple(pop, toolbox, cxpb=0.8, mutpb=0.4, ngen=100, \n","                              stats=stats, verbose=False)\n","et = time.time()\n","elapsed_time = et - st\n","print('Execution time:', elapsed_time, 'seconds')\n","best = tools.selBest(pop, 1)[0]\n","print(\"Best: %s.
