The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Extra memory, usually a stack, is needed to keep track of the nodes discovered so far along a specified branch which helps in backtracking of the graph.(wikipedia)\n","\n","   The route is [1, 6, 5], and total cost is 23\n","\n","\n"]}]}
