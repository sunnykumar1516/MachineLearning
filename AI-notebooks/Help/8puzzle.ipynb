State: a 3x3 array with numbers 1-8 for the tiles and ‘E’ for the blank space.\n","2. Action: instead of moving the tiles, it would be much easier to implement if we\n","move the blank space up, down, left and right. We need to check the boundary\n","conditions to decide which of the four moves are valid for a given state.\n","3. Goal test: check if the current state is the goal state, such as shown in the above\n","figure.\n","4. Path cost: equal step cost – assigned to 1 per move.\n","(source:- course material)"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"K7-T2GkQ99WU","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1673140969985,"user_tz":0,"elapsed":6835,"user":{"displayName":"sunny kumar","userId":"17706325443169451019"}},"outputId":"4f8096ae-beaf-4df2-c6be-ff5846ce8686"},"source":["!pip install simpleai\n","from simpleai.search import SearchProblem, astar, greedy, breadth_first, depth_first\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Looking in indexes: https://pypi.org/simple, https://us-python.pkg.dev/colab-wheels/public/simple/\n","Collecting simpleai\n","  Downloading simpleai-0.8.3.tar.gz (94 kB)\n","\u001b[?25l     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m0.0/94.4 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m?\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m-:--:--\u001b[0m\r\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m94.4/94.4 KB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.8 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h  Preparing metadata (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","Building wheels for collected packages: simpleai\n","  Building wheel for simpleai (setup.py) ... \u001b[?25l\u001b[?25hdone\n","  Created wheel for simpleai: filename=simpleai-0.8.3-py3-none-any.whl size=101000 sha256=104474e00d85b11e809fbf7dd241830d49ea2e6d64b4f7f682e4fa662645129b\n","  Stored in directory: /root/.cache/pip/wheels/5d/2d/67/00b435b82fb8b17a0835aa94f2c614a6dd4b375837c0071be0\n","Successfully built simpleai\n","Installing collected packages: simpleai\n","Successfully installed simpleai-0.8.3\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"khxQXKs1-Obs"},"source":["# Class containing methods to solve the puzzle \n","class PuzzleSolver(SearchProblem):\n","      # Action method to get the list of the possible numbers that can be moved in to the empty space \n","      def actions(self, cur_state): \n","          rows = string_to_list(cur_state) \n","          row_empty, col_empty = get_location(rows, 'E')\n","\n","          actions = []\n","          if row_empty > 0: actions.append(rows[row_empty -
